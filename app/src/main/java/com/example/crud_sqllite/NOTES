SQLiteDatabase db =openOrCreateDatabase(database name,mode,cursorfactory);

steps:

1. First i created java files for accessing SQLLiteOpenHelper (helper class)  ---named as DatabaseHelper
2. In DatabaseHelper file we extend the the current class file with SQLOpenHelper and implement the methods
    We pass database version, table name , context and factory in its constructor
    In onCreate() we execute create query which will be executed when app is created and in OnUpgrade method we wrote DROP table if exists query

3. Now we create a new java java named DatabaseManager, inside which we declare reference variable of DatabaseHelper , context and SqlLiteDatabase

    Now we create a constructor to set context and then we open the database overriding DataManager open()
    In DatabaseManager open() we call the DBhelper object and pass context in it using new keyboard and
    we use reference variable of dbhelper to call getWritableDatabase();

    Now in the same file we create functions to execute SQL FUNCTIONS like insert update delete etc;
    For passing the values into database we use COntentValues is used to store set of data using its put() method
    and then we use SQLLiteDatabase object to call insert(table name, null column hack , contentvalues) for inserting the data

    In short we use DatabaseManager file for writing code to provide functionality to perform CRUD OPERATIONS

4. For  fetching data from table itself we use CURSOR to point to the current row and fetch current row data , and using it we can simultaneously detch the data from database table
